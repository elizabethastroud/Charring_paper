# Charring_paper
Files for the data in brief article: "The experimental heating of rye, oat, spelt, wheat and barley between 215 and 300°C: the stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic data and the photographic evidence of changes to the morphology of the grains". 

Authors: Elizabeth Stroud, Michael Charles, Amy Bogaard, Erika Nitsch, Helena Hamerow

The data was also used in the article: Stroud, E. Charles, M. Bogaard, A. and Hamerow, H. "Turning up the heat: understanding the impact of charring between 215- 300°C on cereal grain morphology and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values in rye, oat, wheat and barley" Journal of Archaeological Science. A copy of the manuscript for this paper is included in the folder Paper1_JAS and will be replace with the final article when in press.
