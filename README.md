# Charring_paper

Files for the data in brief (DiB) article: "The experimental heating of rye, oat, spelt, wheat and barley between 215 and 300°C: the stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic data and the photographic evidence of changes to the morphology of the grains".

Authors: Elizabeth Stroud, Michael Charles, Amy Bogaard, Erika Nitsch, Helena Hamerow

The data was also used in the JAS article: Stroud, E. Charles, M. Bogaard, A. and Hamerow, H. (2023) "Turning up the heat: understanding the impact of charring between 215- 300°C on cereal grain morphology and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values in rye, oat, wheat and barley" Journal of Archaeological Science 153. This article is accessible [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2023.105754).

The files included are:

Charring script.R: the R script which contains all code used in Stroud et al. (2023) and Stroud et al. (DiB) for both data analysis and figure construction.

Dataset_1.csv: the full isotopic data set for all new isotopic measurements as well as the Nitsch et al. (2015) data set.

Dataset_2.pdf: the photographs of the grains showing the internal and external morphology at different temperatures - this includes modified published photographs, and unpublished photographs from the Stroud et al (2023) paper and Nitsch experiment.

Table_1\_RawStandardC.csv: The carbon standards' (both check and calibration) isotopic values for the different analytical sessions of the newly analysed samples

Table_2\_RawStandardsN.csv: The nitrogen standards' (both check and calibration) isotopic values for the different analytical sessions of the newly analysed samples

Table_3\_RepCar.csv: The carbon values of the duplicated samples used for precision calculations

Table_4\_RepNit.csv: The nitrogen values of the duplicated samples used for precision

Table_5.xlsx: Table 5 in the data in brief paper. All values in this can be created using the R script

Table_6\_pcwloss.csv: The averaged percentage mass loss of the grains at the different temperature/time combinations
